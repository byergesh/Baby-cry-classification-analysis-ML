Project Summary: Cry Classification Models

This repository houses the codebase for a mobile application aimed at classifying infant cries. The application utilizes machine learning models trained on a crowdsourced dataset, which involved extensive data augmentation and feature engineering techniques to handle class imbalance effectively.

The developed model demonstrates robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 88% when employing traditional machine learning classification algorithms. Additionally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on Mel Spectrogram images extracted from sound data, achieving a commendable accuracy of 87%.

This repository contains the necessary resources and codebase for implementing the cry classification model within a mobile application, enabling real-time classification of infant cries. The application has the potential to assist caregivers in identifying and responding to their infants' needs promptly and accurate
